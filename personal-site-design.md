 Q)How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
    It has to be smooth I don't want to be flashy but to show that I can implement ideas and scipts with out it being in their face.

 Q)How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
   I want to keep the blog design similar to what I have but do need to tidy up some design aspects like the typography and would love to get some PHP in there to make it a functioning blog. But I do want to keep the blog aspect of it a simple tidy blog. What I will add thought is a new landing page with a link to the blog, portfolio and contact etc. I'll need to look at some more portfolios to see what I like but I can change it later if I see something new or a better way of doing something.
